### Freelink Fall 2020

## Application Overview:
Freelink is a website that allows users to share Shadowsocks, V2Ray, and other anonymous proxy server information to help each other. With its collected information, freelink can help people gain access to blocked network services. Freelink is different from other sharing websites in ways where its users are able to interact with each other so together they can provide more up-to-date resources.

### Conclusion:
During the design of user interface,we learned a lot about using frontend tools like bootstrap and css.
There are some technical difficulties while implementing frontend javascript and the difficulties was solved by learning more html dom knowledges.
We think it would be better if we had more knowledge about authentication and rendering using javascript.
