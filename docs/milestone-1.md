Innovative Idea
Our idea is to create a website that helps people bypass network censorship in some countries, such as China. Our web application allows users to share Shadowsocks, V2Ray, and other anonymous proxy server information to help each other. With everyone's effort in the community, we expect our work can significantly help people gain access to blocked network services. Users can leave comments on the shared information and rate each server link. The users' profiles will include a collection of their uploaded, favorite servers, and comments.Our project takes inspiration from the website lncn.org. However our project will be different in ways where our users are able to interact with each other so together they can provide more up-to-date resources.
